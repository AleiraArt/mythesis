                <h4>THE AUDIENCE</h4><br>
            </p>
            <p>M. de Tréville was at the moment in rather ill-humor,
                nevertheless he saluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground;
                and he smiled on receiving D’Artagnan’s response, the Béarnese accent of which
                recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country—a double
                remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the
                antechamber and making a sign to D’Artagnan with his hand, as if to ask his
                permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called three
                times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through the intervening
                tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Athos! Porthos! Aramis!”
                </p>
                <p>
                The two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who
                answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group of
                which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the door of
                which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their appearance, although
                it was not quite at ease, excited by its carelessness, at once full of dignity
                and submission, the admiration of D’Artagnan, who beheld in these two men
                demigods, and in their leader an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.
                </p>
                <p>
                When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind them; when
                the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons which had been made
                had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced; when M. de Tréville had
                three or four times paced in silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole
                length of his cabinet, passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as
                upright and silent as if on parade—he stopped all at once full in front
                of them, and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, “Do you know
                what the king said to me,” cried he, “and that no longer ago than yesterday
                evening—do you know, gentlemen?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “No,” replied the two Musketeers, after a moment’s silence, “no, sir, we do
                not.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,” added Aramis, in his
                politest tone and with his most graceful bow.
                </p>
                <p>
                “He told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the
                Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “The Guards of the cardinal! And why so?” asked Porthos, warmly.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being
                enlivened by a mixture of good wine.”
                </p>
                <p class="footnote">
                * A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.
                </p>
                <p>
                The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D’Artagnan did not
                know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes, yes,” continued M. de Tréville, growing warmer as he spoke, “and his
                majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the Musketeers make but
                a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related yesterday while playing with
                the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before
                yesterday those <i>damned Musketeers</i>, those <i>daredevils</i>—he
                dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to
                me—those <i>braggarts</i>, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat’s
                eye, had made a riot in the Rue Férou in a cabaret, and that a party of his
                Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest
                the rioters! <i>Morbleu!</i> You must know something about it. Arrest
                Musketeers! You were among them—you were! Don’t deny it; you were
                recognized, and the cardinal named you. But it’s all my fault; yes, it’s all my
                fault, because it is myself who selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did
                you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock?
                And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a
                sword of straw from it? And Athos—I don’t see Athos. Where is he?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Ill—”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Very ill, say you? And of what malady?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “It is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir,” replied Porthos, desirous of
                taking his turn in the conversation; “and what is serious is that it will
                certainly spoil his face.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “The smallpox! That’s a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the smallpox
                at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed, perhaps. Ah, if I knew!
                S’blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have this haunting of bad places,
                this quarreling in the streets, this swordplay at the crossways; and above all,
                I will not have occasion given for the cardinal’s Guards, who are brave, quiet,
                skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested, and who,
                besides, never allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of
                it—they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a
                step. To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee—that is good for the
                king’s Musketeers!”
                </p>
                <p>
                Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have strangled M.
                de Tréville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not felt it was the great
                love he bore them which made him speak thus. They stamped upon the carpet with
                their feet; they bit their lips till the blood came, and grasped the hilts of
                their swords with all their might. All without had heard, as we have said,
                Athos, Porthos, and Aramis called, and had guessed, from M. de Tréville’s tone
                of voice, that he was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued
                to the tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to
                the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths repeated
                as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in
                the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the cabinet to the street
                gate, the whole hôtel was boiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Ah! The king’s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal, are
                they?” continued M. de Tréville, as furious at heart as his soldiers, but
                emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to say, like so many
                blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors. “What! Six of his
                Eminence’s Guards arrest six of his Majesty’s Musketeers! <i>Morbleu!</i> My
                part is taken! I will go straight to the Louvre; I will give in my resignation
                as captain of the king’s Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal’s
                Guards, and if he refuses me, <i>morbleu!</i> I will turn abbé.”
                </p>
                <p>
                At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to be heard
                but oaths and blasphemies. The <i>morbleus</i>, the <i>sang Dieus</i>, the
                <i>morts touts les diables</i>, crossed one another in the air. D’Artagnan
                looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an
                immense inclination to crawl under the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Well, my Captain,” said Porthos, quite beside himself, “the truth is that we
                were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means; and before we had
                time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead, and Athos, grievously
                wounded, was very little better. For you know Athos. Well, Captain, he
                endeavored twice to get up, and fell again twice. And we did not
                surrender—no! They dragged us away by force. On the way we escaped. As
                for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and left him very quiet on the field
                of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away. That’s the
                whole story. What the devil, Captain, one cannot win all one’s battles! The
                great Pompey lost that of Pharsalia; and Francis the First, who was, as I have
                heard say, as good as other folks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “And I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with his own
                sword,” said Aramis; “for mine was broken at the first parry. Killed him, or
                poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “I did not know that,” replied M. de Tréville, in a somewhat softened tone.
                “The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “But pray, sir,” continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become appeased,
                ventured to risk a prayer, “do not say that Athos is wounded. He would be in
                despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and as the wound is very
                serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest,
                it is to be feared—”
                </p>
                <p>
                At this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head, but
                frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Athos!” cried the two Musketeers.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Athos!” repeated M. de Tréville himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                “You have sent for me, sir,” said Athos to M. de Tréville, in a feeble yet
                perfectly calm voice, “you have sent for me, as my comrades inform me, and I
                have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you want with me?”
                </p>
                <p>
                And at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as usual,
                with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Tréville, moved to the
                bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang toward him.
                </p>
                <p>
                “I was about to say to these gentlemen,” added he, “that I forbid my Musketeers
                to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very dear to the king, and
                the king knows that his Musketeers are the bravest on the earth. Your hand,
                Athos!”
                </p>
                <p>
                And without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection,
                M. de Tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might, without
                perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his self-command, allowed a slight
                murmur of pain to escape him, and if possible, grew paler than he was before.
                </p>
                <p>
                The door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by the
                arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known to all. A
                burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain; and two or three
                heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, appeared through the
                openings of the tapestry. M. de Tréville was about to reprehend this breach of
                the rules of etiquette, when he felt the hand of Athos, who had rallied all his
                energies to contend against pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor
                as if he were dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                “A surgeon!” cried M. de Tréville, “mine! The king’s! The best! A surgeon! Or,
                s’blood, my brave Athos will die!”
                </p>
                <p>
                At the cries of M. de Tréville, the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet,
                he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all crowded round the
                wounded man. But all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor
                so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel. He pushed through the
                crowd, approached Athos, still insensible, and as all this noise and commotion
                inconvenienced him greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing,
                that the Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M.
                de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore their
                comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and behind the
                surgeon the door closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                The cabinet of M. de Tréville, generally held so sacred, became in an instant
                the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and vociferated,
                swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his Guards to all the
                devils.
                </p>
                <p>
                An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de Tréville
                alone remaining with the wounded.
                </p>
                <p>
                At length, M. de Tréville himself returned. The injured man had recovered his
                senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the Musketeer had nothing in
                it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness having been purely and simply
                caused by loss of blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then M. de Tréville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except
                D’Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the tenacity
                of a Gascon remained in his place.
                </p>
                <p>
                When all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Tréville, on turning
                round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which had occurred had
                in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He inquired what was the will of
                his persevering visitor. D’Artagnan then repeated his name, and in an instant
                recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past, M. de Tréville
                grasped the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Pardon me,” said he, smiling, “pardon me my dear compatriot, but I had wholly
                forgotten you. But what help is there for it! A captain is nothing but a father
                of a family, charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an
                ordinary family. Soldiers are big children; but as I maintain that the orders
                of the king, and more particularly the orders of the cardinal, should be
                executed—”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Tréville judged that
                he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the conversation, came straight to
                the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                “I respected your father very much,” said he. “What can I do for the son? Tell
                me quickly; my time is not my own.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, “on quitting Tarbes and coming hither, it was my
                intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship which you have
                not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all that I have seen
                during the last two hours, I comprehend that such a favor is enormous, and
                tremble lest I should not merit it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “It is indeed a favor, young man,” replied M. de Tréville, “but it may not be
                so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear to believe.
                But his majesty’s decision is always necessary; and I inform you with regret
                that no one becomes a Musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several
                campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or a service of two years in some other
                regiment less favored than ours.”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the Musketeer’s
                uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the
                attainment of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                “But,” continued M. de Tréville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing
                that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart, “on account
                of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I will do something for you,
                young man. Our recruits from Béarn are not generally very rich, and I have no
                reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since I left the
                province. I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, “I ask alms of
                no man.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Oh, that’s very well, young man,” continued M. de Tréville, “that’s all very
                well. I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four crowns in my purse,
                and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was not in a condition
                to purchase the Louvre.”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan’s bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale of his
                horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de Tréville
                possessed at the commencement of his.
                </p>
                <p>
                “You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large the sum
                may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises
                becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the Director of the Royal
                Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself. Do not
                refuse this little service. Our best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes
                solicit it without being able to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship,
                swordsmanship in all its branches, and dancing. You will make some desirable
                acquaintances; and from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how
                you are getting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not but
                perceive a little coldness in this reception.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Alas, sir,” said he, “I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of
                introduction which my father gave me to present to you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “I certainly am surprised,” replied M. de Tréville, “that you should undertake
                so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor
                Béarnese.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “I had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,” cried D’Artagnan; “but
                it was perfidiously stolen from me.”
                </p>
                <p>
                He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman with
                the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted
                M. de Tréville.
                </p>
                <p>
                “This is all very strange,” said M. de Tréville, after meditating a minute;
                “you mentioned my name, then, aloud?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have done
                otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way. Judge if I
                should not put myself under its protection.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Tréville loved incense as
                well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from a smile of
                visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the
                adventure of Meung, “Tell me,” continued he, “had not this gentlemen a slight
                scar on his cheek?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Was he not a fine-looking man?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Of lofty stature.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Of pale complexion and brown hair?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?
                If I ever find him again—and I will find him, I swear, were it in hell!”
                </p>
                <p>
                “He was waiting for a woman,” continued Tréville.
                </p>
                <p>
                “He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he
                awaited.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “You know not the subject of their conversation?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Was this woman English?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “He called her Milady.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “It is he; it must be he!” murmured Tréville. “I believed him still at
                Brussels.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Oh, sir, if you know who this man is,” cried D’Artagnan, “tell me who he is,
                and whence he is. I will then release you from all your promises—even
                that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers; for before everything, I
                wish to avenge myself.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “Beware, young man!” cried Tréville. “If you see him coming on one side of the
                street, pass by on the other. Do not cast yourself against such a rock; he
                would break you like glass.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “That will not prevent me,” replied D’Artagnan, “if ever I find him.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “In the meantime,” said Tréville, “seek him not—if I have a right to
                advise you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion. This great
                hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man, who—a
                rather improbable thing—had stolen his father’s letter from him—was
                there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might not this young man be
                sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare
                for him? This pretended D’Artagnan—was he not an emissary of the
                cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce into Tréville’s house, to place
                near him, to win his confidence, and afterward to ruin him as had been done in
                a thousand other instances? He fixed his eyes upon D’Artagnan even more
                earnestly than before. He was moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of
                that countenance, full of astute intelligence and affected humility. “I know he
                is a Gascon,” reflected he, “but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for
                me. Let us try him.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “My friend,” said he, slowly, “I wish, as the son of an ancient
                friend—for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly
                true—I wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked
                in my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The king
                and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent bickerings are only
                feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a compatriot, a handsome
                cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his way, should become the dupe of
                all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others
                who have been ruined by it. Be assured that I am devoted to both these
                all-powerful masters, and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the
                service of the king, and also the cardinal—one of the most illustrious
                geniuses that France has ever produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you entertain,
                whether from your family, your relations, or even from your instincts, any of
                these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal, bid
                me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you in many ways, but without
                attaching you to my person. I hope that my frankness at least will make you my
                friend; for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have
                done to you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Tréville said to himself: “If the cardinal has set this young fox upon me, he
                will certainly not have failed—he, who knows how bitterly I execrate
                him—to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to
                rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if it be as I
                suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his Eminence in
                horror.”
                </p>
                <p>
                It, however, proved otherwise. D’Artagnan answered, with the greatest
                simplicity: “I came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My father advised me
                to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and yourself—whom he
                considered the first three personages in France.”
                </p>
                <p>
                D’Artagnan added M. de Tréville to the others, as may be perceived; but he
                thought this addition would do no harm.
                </p>
                <p>
                “I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,” continued he, “and the most
                profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me, sir, if you speak
                to me, as you say, with frankness—for then you will do me the honor to
                esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you have entertained any doubt,
                as naturally you may, I feel that I am ruining myself by speaking the truth.
                But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it, and that is my object
                beyond all others.”
                </p>
                <p>
                M. de Tréville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much penetration, so
                much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely remove his suspicions.
                The more this young man was superior to others, the more he was to be dreaded
                if he meant to deceive him. Nevertheless, he pressed D’Artagnan’s hand, and
                said to him: “You are an honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do
                for you that which I just now offered. My hôtel will be always open to you.
                Hereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to take
                advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that which you
                desire.”
                </p>
                <p>
                “That is to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “that you will wait until I have proved
                myself worthy of it. Well, be assured,” added he, with the familiarity of a
                Gascon, “you shall not wait long.” And he bowed in order to retire, and as if
                he considered the future in his own hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                “But wait a minute,” said M. de Tréville, stopping him. “I promised you a
                letter for the director of the Academy. Are you too proud to accept it, young
                gentleman?”
                </p>
                <p>
                “No, sir,” said D’Artagnan; “and I will guard it so carefully that I will be
                sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who shall attempt to
                take it from me!”
                </p>
                <p>
                M. de Tréville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man compatriot in
                the embrasure of the window, where they had talked together, he seated himself
                at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation. While he
                was doing this, D’Artagnan, having no better employment, amused himself with
                beating a march upon the window and with looking at the Musketeers, who went
                away, one after another, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                M. de Tréville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,
                approached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very moment
                when D’Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de Tréville was highly
                astonished to see his <i>protégé</i> make a sudden spring, become crimson with
                passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, “S’blood, he shall not escape me
                this time!”
                </p>
                <p>
                “And who?” asked M. de Tréville.
                </p>
                <p>
                “He, my thief!” replied D’Artagnan. “Ah, the traitor!” and he disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                “The devil take the madman!” murmured M. de Tréville, “unless,” added he, “this
                is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in his purpose!”

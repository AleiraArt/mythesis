            </p>

            <p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable.<br><br> Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</p> <br>

<p>“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</p><br>

<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.</p><br>

<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.<br><br> Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his</p><br>


<p>Being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
    report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
    seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a
    number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
    that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,
    his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
    assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his
    two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p><br>
    
    <p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
    countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
    with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
    looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
    of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
    the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
    his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. <br><br>The gentlemen
    pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
    much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
    admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
    which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
    proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
    large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
    disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
    friend.</p><br>
    
    <p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
    people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
    was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
    himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
    themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
    only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
    introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
    walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
    His character was decided.<br><br> He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
    the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
    Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
    his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
    having slighted one of her daughters.</p><br>
    
    <p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
    down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
    standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
    Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
    friend to join it.</p><br>
    
    <p>“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
    standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
    dance.”</p><br>
    
    <p>“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
    particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
    would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
    another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
    stand up with.”</p><br>
    
    <p>“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a
    kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
    life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
    uncommonly pretty.”</p><br>
    
    <p>“<i>You</i> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
    Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p><br>
    
    <p>“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
    of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
    dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”</p><br>

    <p>
        “She is tolerable”<br>
        </p><br>

        <p>“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
            Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
            “She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me</i>; and I am in no
            humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
            by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
            smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</p><br>
            
            <p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
            remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,
            however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
            playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</p><br>
            
            <p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
            Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
            party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
            distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her
            mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s
            pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
            accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
            fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
            had yet learnt to care for at a ball. <br><br>They returned, therefore, in good
            spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
            were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
            book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
            good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
            such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
            views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
            had a very different story to hear.</p><br>
            
            <p>“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
            delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
            Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
            she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
            her twice. Only think of <i>that</i>, my dear: he actually danced with her
            twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
            time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.<br><br> I was so vexed to see him stand
            up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
            can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
            down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
            asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss
            King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
            again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the <i>Boulanger</i>——”</p><br>
            
            <p>“If he had had any compassion for <i>me</i>,” cried her husband impatiently,
            “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
            his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”</p><br>
            
            <p>“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He
            is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
            in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
            lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown——”</p><br>
            
            <p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
            description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
            of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
            exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</p><br>
            
            <p>“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
            suiting <i>his</i> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
            all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring

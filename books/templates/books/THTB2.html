                <h4>Chapter II. The Curse of the Baskervilles</h4><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.
              </p>
          <p>
                “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.
              </p>
          <p>
                “It is an old manuscript.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “How can you say that, sir?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
                that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
                the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
                my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
                “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
                whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
                excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well
                as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
                practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document
                very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
                eventually overtake him.”
               </p>
          <p>
                Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
                his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the
                long <i>s</i> and the short. It is one of several indications which
                enabled me to fix the date.”
               </p>
          <p>
                I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At
                the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in large, scrawling
                figures: “1742.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville
                family.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
                which you wish to consult me?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
                within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
                connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.”
               </p>
          <p>
                Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
                closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
                manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
                curious, old-world narrative:
              </p>
          <p><i>
                  “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
                  many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville,
                  and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have
                  set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth.
                   And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which
                  punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so
                  heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then
                  from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be
                  circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family
                  has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.<br><br>
          
                      “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
                  history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend
                  to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that
                  name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and
                  godless man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
                  seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was
                  in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word
                  through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed,
                  so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of
                  a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young
                  maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for
                  she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this
                  Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down
                  upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being
                  from home, as he well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the
                  maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat
                  down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor
                  lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and
                  shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they
                  say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were
                  such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the stress of
                  her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most
                  active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and
                  still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so
                  homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall
                  and her father’s farm.<br><br>
          
                      “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests
                  to carry food and drink—with other worse things,
                  perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the
                  bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a
                  devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang
                  upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he
                  cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render
                  his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
                  wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man,
                  one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out
                  that they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the
                  house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and
                  unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the
                  maid’s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the
                  moonlight over the moor.<br><br>
          
                      “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to
                  understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon their
                  bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done
                  upon the moorlands.  Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for
                  their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of
                  wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and
                  the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in
                  pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly
                  abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she
                  were to reach her own home.<br><br>
          
                      “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
                  night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he
                  had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with
                  fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed
                  seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I
                  have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville
                  passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a
                  hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’  So the
                  drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.  But soon their
                  skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the
                  black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle
                  and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a great
                  fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each,
                  had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his
                  horse’s head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last
                  upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour and their breed,
                  were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we
                  call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting
                  hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before
                  them.<br><br>
          
                      “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
                  guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by no means
                  advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken,
                  rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which
                  stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set
                  by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining
                  bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid
                  where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the
                  sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville
                  lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
                  dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and
                  plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,
                  shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has
                  rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of
                  Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping
                  jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life,
                  still screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that very
                  night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for
                  the rest of their days.<br><br>
          
                      “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which
                  is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since.  If I have set
                  it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than
                  that which is but hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that
                  many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been
                  sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter ourselves in the
                  infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the
                  innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in
                  Holy Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I
                  counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in
                  those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.<br><br>
          
                      “[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,
                  with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister
                  Elizabeth.]”</i>

          <p>
                When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
                his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
                Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
                fire.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Well?” said he.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Do you not find it interesting?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “To a collector of fairy tales.”
               </p>
          <p>
                Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is
                the <i>Devon County Chronicle</i> of May 14th of this year. It is a short account
                of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which
                occurred a few days before that date.”
               </p>
          <p>
                My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our
                visitor readjusted his glasses and began:
              </p>
          <p> <i>
                  “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
                  has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at
                  the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.  Though Sir
                  Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short
                  period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the
                  affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
                  him.  In these days of <i>nouveaux riches</i> it is refreshing to find a case
                  where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days
                  is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to
                  restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well
                  known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise
                  than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realised
                  his gains and returned to England with them.  It is only two years
                  since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common
                  talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
                  which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it
                  was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,
                  within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have
                  personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous
                  donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled
                  in these columns.<br><br>
          
                      “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
                  cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at
                  least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local
                  superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect
                  foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural
                  causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have
                  been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his
                  considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his
                  indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named
                  Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
                  Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show
                  that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been impaired, and
                  points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
                  changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous
                  depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the
                  deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.<br><br>
          
                      “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
                  was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the
                  famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence of the Barrymores
                  shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles
                  had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had
                  ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as
                  usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the
                  habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At twelve o’clock
                  Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and,
                  lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.  The day had been
                  wet, and Sir Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the
                  alley.  Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to
                  the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some
                  little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the
                  far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been
                  explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master’s
                  footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the
                  moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking
                  upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no
                  great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to
                  have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is
                  unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of violence
                  were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person, and though the
                  doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial
                  distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe
                  that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him—it
                  was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
                  dyspnœa and death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne
                  out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
                  disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict in accordance
                  with the medical evidence.  It is well that this is so, for it is
                  obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should
                  settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
                  interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an
                  end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection
                  with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for
                  Baskerville Hall.  It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry
                  Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles
                  Baskerville’s younger brother.  The young man when last heard of
                  was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to
                  informing him of his good fortune.”<br></i>
              </p>
          <p>
                Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. “Those are
                the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles
                Baskerville.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my attention to a
                case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed
                some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by
                that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the
                Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article,
                you say, contains all the public facts?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “It does.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his finger-tips
                together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.
              </p>
          <p>
                “In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
                strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My
                motive for withholding it from the coroner’s inquiry is that a man of
                science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to
                indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville
                Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything
                were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
                reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew,
                since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no
                reason why I should not be perfectly frank.
              </p>
          <p>
                “The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
                are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir
                Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall,
                and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education
                within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his
                illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept
                us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa,
                and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the
                comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir
                Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken
                this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart—so much so
                that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him
                to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr.
                Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his
                family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his
                ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
                constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me
                whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange
                creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me
                several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.
              </p>
          <p>
                “I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three
                weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had
                descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his
                eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression
                of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a
                glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the
                head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to
                go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It
                was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression
                upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that
                occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to
                my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention
                this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the
                tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter
                was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.
              </p>
          <p>
                “It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart
                was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however
                chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect
                upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of
                town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was
                much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the
                last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
              </p>
          <p>
                “On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who made the
                discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting
                up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event.
                I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the
                inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at
                the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
                shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other
                footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I
                carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival.
                Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the
                ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an
                extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly
                no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by
                Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the
                ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little
                distance off, but fresh and clear.”

                <h4>Chapter I. Mr. Sherlock Holmes</h4><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon
                those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the
                breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which
                our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
                piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang
                lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
                across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,” was
                engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just such a stick as the
                old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry—dignified, solid,
                and reassuring.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”
               </p>
          <p>
                Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
                occupation.
              </p>
          <p>
                “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of
                your head.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
                me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor’s
                stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion
                of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear
                you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
                companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
                well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
                appreciation.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
                practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Why so?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
                knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
                The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
                great amount of walking with it.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.
              </p>
          <p>
                “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should guess that
                to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly
                given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
                presentation in return.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back his chair
                and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in all the accounts
                which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you
                have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not
                yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without
                possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my
                dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”
               </p>
          <p>
                He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me
                keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my
                admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his
                methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system
                as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick
                from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then
                with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying
                the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his favourite
                corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two indications upon the
                stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I trust
                that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
                erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
                in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not
                that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
                country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Then I was right.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “To that extent.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “But that was all.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would suggest,
                for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a
                hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed
                before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest
                themselves.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “You may be right.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working
                hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of
                this unknown visitor.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing Cross
                Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in
                town before going to the country.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in
                this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a
                presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a
                pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer
                withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for
                himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been
                a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,
                stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
                occasion of the change?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “It certainly seems probable.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the <i>staff</i> of the
                hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
                hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
                What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he
                could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician—little
                more than a senior student. And he left five years ago—the date is
                on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
                thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
                amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog,
                which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller
                than a mastiff.”
               </p>
          <p>
                I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and
                blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
              </p>
          <p>
                “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I, “but at
                least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man’s
                age and professional career.” From my small medical shelf I took down the
                Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers,
                but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.
              </p>
          <p >
                  <i>“Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
                  House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of
                  the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled
                  ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member of the
                  Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of
                  Atavism’ (<i>Lancet</i> 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’
                  (<i>Journal of Psychology</i>, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the
                  parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”</i>
              </p>
          <p>
                “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a mischievous
                smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that
                I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I
                remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my
                experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives
                testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the
                country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
                visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “And the dog?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
                heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
                his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown in the space
                between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
                broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been—yes, by Jove, it <i>is</i> a
                curly-haired spaniel.”
               </p>
          <p>
                He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess
                of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I
                glanced up in surprise.
              </p>
          <p>
                “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very
                door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I beg you,
                Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of
                assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you
                hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know
                not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of
                science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”
               </p>
          <p>
                The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a
                typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long
                nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, grey eyes, set
                closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed
                glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for
                his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long
                back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
                and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon
                the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of
                joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not sure whether I had left it
                here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the
                world.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.
              </p>
          <p>
                “Yes, sir.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “From Charing Cross Hospital?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.
              </p>
          <p>
                Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. “Why was it
                bad?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you
                say?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a
                consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes. “And now,
                Dr. James Mortimer—”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of
                the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I
                am addressing and not—”
               </p>
          <p>
                “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection
                with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had
                hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
                supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
                finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the
                original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum.
                It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your
                skull.”
               </p>
          <p>
                Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are an
                enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,”
                 said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
                cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”
               </p>
          <p>
                The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
                with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
                restless as the antennæ of an insect.
              </p>
          <p>
                Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
                which he took in our curious companion. “I presume, sir,” said he at last,
                “that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you
                have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that
                as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself
                an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most
                serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the
                second highest expert in Europe—”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?” asked
                Holmes with some asperity.
              </p>
          <p>
                “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
                must always appeal strongly.”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Then had you not better consult him?”
               </p>
          <p>
                “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of
                affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have
                not inadvertently—”
               </p>
          <p>
                “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely
                if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature
                of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.”
